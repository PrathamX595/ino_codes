This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects and experiments I've worked on. Each folder contains a specific project with its corresponding `.ino` file.

## Project Overview

### Sensors & Input/Output
Basic sensor interfacing projects including displays, temperature monitoring, distance measurement, fire detection, and water level sensing.

### Motors & Servos
Motor control projects featuring servo positioning, stepper motors, and DC motor drivers with various input methods.

### User Interface & Controls
Projects focusing on user interaction through keypads, buttons, and wireless communication interfaces.

### Display & Games
Interactive displays and simple games using LCDs, including countdown timers and scoring systems.

### Specialized Projects
Advanced projects involving shift registers, robotic arms, security systems, and automated display cases.

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains an Arduino sketch with component-specific code for sensors, displays, and actuators.

Common libraries used:
- `Servo.h`, `LiquidCrystal.h`, `Keypad.h`, `SimpleDHT.h`, ...etc.

## Hardware Requirements

Projects utilize standard Arduino components including sensors, displays, motors, and interface modules.
